People with a high need for achievement are willing to take risks, work hard, and persevere in order to achieve their goals.\n\n- **Need for Power (n-Pow):** The drive to have influence and control over others. People with a high need for power are motivated by the desire to lead, to be in charge, and to have control over their environment.\n\n- **Need for Affiliation (n-Aff):** The drive to form and maintain relationships with others. People with a high need for affiliation are motivated by the desire to be accepted, to belong, and to be a part of a group.\n\nAccording to the theory, these three needs are innate and they can vary in strength from person to person. They can change over time depending on an individual's life experiences.\n\n### Conceptual model of enterpreneurship\n\nA conceptual model of entrepreneurship is a framework that helps to explain the various factors and processes involved in the creation and development of new businesses.

This includes researching market trends, identifying customer needs, and analyzing the competition.\n\n- **Resource acquisition:** The process of acquiring the necessary resources, including funding, personnel, and equipment, to start and grow a business.\n\n- **Business planning:** The process of developing a plan for the business, including strategies for marketing, sales, and operations.\n\n- **Implementation:** The process of turning the business plan into action by launching the business and managing its day-to-day operations.\n\n- **Growth and expansion:** The process of growing and expanding the business, including the development of new products or services, the acquisition of new customers, and the expansion into new markets.\n\n- **Exit:** The process of selling or closing the business, which can include a variety of options such as an initial public offering (IPO), a merger or acquisition, or a management buyout.\n\n### Intrapreneurs\n\n- An intrapreneur is an individual who acts like an entrepreneur within a larger organization. This person takes on a proactive role in driving innovation, creativity, and growth within the organization, rather than simply carrying out the tasks assigned to them. Intrapreneurs are often focused on developing new products, services, or processes that can benefit the organization.\n\n- Intrapreneurship is a term used to describe the process of fostering an entrepreneurial mindset within an organization.

This includes providing resources, time and freedom for employees to explore new ideas and projects.\n\n- **Opportunity identification:** Intrapreneurs need to be able to identify new opportunities for growth and innovation within the organization. This requires a process for identifying and evaluating new ideas, and a system for providing feedback and support to employees.\n\n- **Resource allocation:** Intrapreneurs need access to the resources they need to develop and implement their ideas.
